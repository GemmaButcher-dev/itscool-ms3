## Responsiveness & Compatability Testing

To ensure a broad range of users can successfully use this site, I tested it across the 5 major browsers in both desktop and mobile configuration.

- Chrome *v.74*
- Edge *v.18*
- Firefox *v.67*
- Safari *v.12*
- Opera n/a
- Internet Explorer *v.11*

For testing compatibility, I created a testing matrix to test across multiple devices and browsers. The test matrix can be found seen below.

## JavaScript Testing

### JS Hint

  * All JavaScript code was put though [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) 

| Test      | Screenshot                                              | Notes                                                   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| JS Hint   |![screenshot](documents/testing/jshint_testing.png)      | Passed - No warnings. 1 undefined variable as expected. |

### Summary

 Shows an undefined variable in the script.js file. This variable is defined in a script tag in the 404.html file. For more information see bug fix section in the [development](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Python Testing

### CI Python Linter

  * All Python code in app.py was put though [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) and tested against a beautifier tool called [Code Beautify](https://codebeautify.org/python-formatter-beautifier#).

| Test      | Screenshot                                                                                   | Notes                                                |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| CI python linter           |![screenshot](documents/testing/ci_python_linter_analysis.png) |  Initial testing showing white spaces, incorrect blank lines and some lines were too long.|
| CI python linter re-test 1 |![screenshot](documents/testing/ci_python_linter_2.png)    |  Passed - No warnings           | 
| Code Beutify               |![screenshot](documents/testing/code_beautify_python.png)      |  Made changes to line lengths and some indentation |
| CI python linter re-test 2 |![screenshot](documents/testing/ci_python_linter_2.png)        |  Indicated beautifier tool was not pep8 compliant with line lengths being too long |
| CI python linter re-test 3 |![screenshot](documents/testing/ci_python_linter_fixed.png)    |  Passed - No warnings   |

### Summary

After initially correcting the code format and it passing testing using the CI python linter it seemed that the indentation after breaking a line due to line length wasnt quite aesthetically correct, although meeting pep8 guidlines. The decision was made to use a python beautifier tool which then amended the code and changed the line lengths and indentations. To test if the beautifier tool was pep8 comliant the beautified code was re-run through the CI python linter which then logged warnings for some of the lines being too long. The app.py file was the reverted back to the tested and passed version that was verified by CI python linter, as this meant that  the beautifier tool was not pep8 compliant. As the criteria for this project is that python is to be pep8 compliant, using results and testing of the CI python linter was the most reliable approach.

## Fuzzywuzzy Testing

  * Initially the matching threshold was set to 80% whilst in development.
  * The function and installation was tested by entering random slang words that were stored in the database and by seeing what results were displayed as a match. 
  * At 80% threshold the user needs to be very accurate and close to the correct spelling of the slang word to get a close match. This does not align with the user stories.
  * The threshold was then reduced to 50% and tested in the same way again at 5% intervals. Between 50-65% the results were too broad and the matches were too 'fuzzy'. 
  * 70% match threshold seems to return close enough matches with enough tollerance and flexibility for spelling mistakes for all users.

## Bug Fixes

  * please see the [development](DEVELOPMENT.md) file for bug fix information.

## Other Testing Methods

### Manual Testing

Behaviour driven Development (BDD) is where a project or product is tested to the user stories and by the user. This has also been done in responsiveness and compatability testing section above. 
This form of testing although useful in terms of user story testing can be subject to bias and sometimes things can get missed due to fatigue and is costly in time and resources. BDD is more user-centric and revolves around system behaviour. This is an Agile software development methodology.
It is particuarly useful as it can encompass a wide range of input from stakeholders to managers and is good for planning a project and monitoring throughout its entirety. Goals can be set along the projects way to delivery and measured.

- Below is a table of the manual user testing carried out.

| **Feature**          | **Test Details**           | **Expected results**                      | **Pass/Fail** |

### Automated Testing

Test Driven Development (TDD) is where developers test first and use these results to guide theor development. The process begins when tests are written in order to fail but only so much so that the tests dont break the programme. TDD is thought of as more developer-centric, and is revolves around code correctness.

A popular technique in TDD is Red-Green-Refactor. TDD is a manageable way of testing code breaking it down into manageable chunks. This is explained below;
Red - Write a failing test. Script a test that will fail around a specific function of the programme.
Green - Make the test pass, enough needs to be done to get it to pass and work
Refactor - Clean up the code. Refining the code is done making it efficient and reliable. 

An example of automated testing for this project would be;

-Red - A test is written for Background image does not change on start game button being clicked.

-Green - Add background image function with event listeners to the start game button so background changes on click. 

-Refactor - Tidy code up and minimise where possible. Check reliability. Revisit when more functions or event listeners are added, or the original function is extended. Monitor.

Various language specific frameworks are available to run automated testing. One of the most popular is Jest for testing JavaScript. 

It is best to combine manual and automated testing. Automated tests will not test user experience and tests will only ever be as good as the questions we ask it to perform.

## Further Testing

 * A large amount of testing was carried out to ensure that all pages, buttons, feedback and functions were working correctly.

 * Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user 
      experience issues.

  ### School Testing

  * The app was tested by a local primary school where family attend. Staff member were asked for feedback on the concept, design, experience and additional functionalities desired. Here is theor summary to be considered for future development...

  'Thank you for asking us to review this project. Several members of staff have had a look at this and found it useful. We all agreed that we had not seen anything like this before and to us it is a totally new concept. The overall design is easy to use, and we feel it is appropriate for children and adults that would possibly want to use it. We liked the design, especially the blackboard design. We also liked the colours. Although some of our students may be too young to use it we feel that students aged 10+ would be able to use it without much supervision subject to how content is monitored.
   As teachers professionally and some of us as parents, we feel it would be useful both in a school setting and recreationally. We particuarly liked the heart button and favourites list. 
   Our constructive criticism is that it would be nice if you could take off a word and definition from the list. As teachers it would also be nice to be able to add our thoughts about a word and perhaps a teachers area, community and discussion thread would be very good. Maybe like a forum? We hope you find this feedback useful and look forward to looking at the finished product'.
